"This is a recipe my grandmother used. She lived on a chicken farm,<br> 
so it is as basic and simple as it can get. <br>
Usually all we have to accompany this recipe is mashed potatoes.<br>
It's really nice on cold days and extremely cheap to make." —Clara

<h2>Ingredients</h2>
<ul>
    <li>1 (3 pound) whole chicken</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>    
    <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    <li>dash salt</li>
    <li>4 large eggs</li>
    <li>1 teaspoon vegetable oil</li>
</ul>
<h2>Directions</h2>
<ol>
    <li><strong>Step 1</strong>
        <br>Remove any giblets, rinse the chicken with cold water, and place it into a large saucepan of water. <br>
        Add 1 teaspoon salt, and bring to a boil over high heat. <br>
        Reduce heat to a medium low, and simmer about 1 hour, skimming foam from the broth, until the chicken meat is tender.</li>

       <li><strong>Step 2</strong><br>Mix the flour with a dash of salt in a bowl. With your fingers, make a depression in the top of the flour and drop in the eggs.<br> 
        Add the oil, and stir the eggs into the flour to make a stiff dough.<br> Knead the dough for about 10 minutes, until smooth and elastic, and let it rest, covered, for about 10 minutes.</li> 
        
        <li><strong>Step 3</strong><br>Cut the dough in half, and roll each piece out, on a well-floured surface, into a rectangle shape until it's about 1/8 of an inch thick.<br>
            Sprinkle the dough sheet with flour, and roll it up into a loose cylinder.<br> With a sharp knife, cut 1/2 inch wide noodles from the roll.<br> 
            Unroll the noodles, and sprinkle with flour to prevent them from sticking together.</li>

        <li><strong>Step 4</strong><br>Remove the chicken from the broth and let cool about 10 to 15 minutes, until it's cool enough to handle. <br>
            Remove the skin and strip all of the meat from the bones, and return the chicken meat to the broth.<br> 
            Bring the broth back to a boil, drop in the fresh noodles, and let simmer over medium-low heat for about 10 minutes, until the noodles are tender, slightly puffed and lighter in color.</li>
    </li>
